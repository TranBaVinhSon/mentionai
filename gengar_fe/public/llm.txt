## Product Overview

MentionAI is an innovative AI platform that lets you create intelligent digital versions of yourself that can chat, answer questions, and share your knowledge 24/7. By training AI on your social media posts, blog content, and digital footprint, MentionAI creates a personalized AI assistant that thinks and responds like you.

Tagline: "Multiply your presence without cloning your time. Train MentionAI on your public posts & let it chat like you—privately for reflection or publicly for friends."

## Perfect for Micro-Influencers (5K-20K Followers)
